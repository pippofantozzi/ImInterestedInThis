st.write("In the quaint village of Seabreeze, a curious challenge emerged among a group of friends. They wagered on who could predict where the sea would carry a tiny paper boat within a minute. For weeks, the group meticulously observed the ocean's rhythms, launching countless boats and recording their fates, hoping to uncover a pattern in the chaos. All except for Lily, who approached the task with a different lens. Armed with a deep understanding of the ocean's physicsâ€”its currents, the wind's influence, and the subtle pull of the moonâ€”Lily needed only a day's observation. While her friends relied on brute force and endless data, Lily's insight into the underlying principles allowed her to predict the boat's journey with uncanny accuracy. Her success was a testament to the power of knowledge, serving as a vivid metaphor for Physics-Informed Machine Learning: sometimes, understanding the fundamental laws that govern a system can unveil the most profound truths, far beyond the reach of observation alone.")
